## Review of the code
line30: I would like to see a better format about the number of lines, columns and size of the file. Reading data from typeof and str is very hard. 
line48: what was the point of listing ? it took like 10 minutes to print the file on my computer and I stopped that process since it was pointless. 
line51: same heavy process without a reason
I really like the flow of your code and how tidy and clean it is.
line103: you could use a for loop to make 10 files with 1-10 names in it however this code here is very clean. 
line 189: install.packages("ggplot"), please avoid installing packages in the code. 
line 196: i am getting this error: "Error in `fortify()`:
! `data` must be a <data.frame>, or an object coercible by `fortify()`, not a character vector.
Backtrace:
 1. ggplot2::ggplot(data = "maize_merge")
 2. ggplot2:::ggplot.default(data = "maize_merge")
 4. ggplot2:::fortify.default(data, ...)
Error in fortify(data, ...) :"

## conclusion
Although I found data processing perfect, I  think data inspection is not done in the way it should.
